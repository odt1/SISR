# FAQ

## Where's the GUI?

SISR runs as a **system tray application** by default.

- Right-click the tray icon to show/hide the UI
- Or launch with `-w --window-fullscreen false` to show the window at startup
- **If** the window runs **as overlay** press **`Ctrl+Shift+Alt+S`**
  or **`LB+RB+BACK+A`** (_"A" button needs to be pressed last_) to toggle UI visibility.

You can also run `sisr --help` to see all CLI options

## I don't like the system tray app behavior, can I run it as a normal windowed application?

Yes, you can!  
Launch SISR with `-w --window-fullscreen false` to show the window at startup and disable fullscreen behavior

## I don't like the chosen overlay shortcut/controller chord, can I change it?

You do realize Steam Input can remap controller buttons/shortcuts, right?  
You're smart, you can figure it out 😜

## Why would I use this over Steam Input directly?

SISR can be used to circumvent issues with games and applications that
do not support Steam Input or otherwise pose challenges, like (but not limited to):

- Games with aggressive anti-cheat systems
- Emulators
- Windows Store games/apps
- Games with broken Steam Input support

You can also use SISR to "tunnel"/forward
Steam Input configurations over the network to other machines, including Keyboard/Mouse.  

This makes it possible to use devices like a Steam Deck as a dedicated controller
without the need to stream the entire game

!!! info
    That said, if you do not have issues with Steam Input directly, you probably should not use SISR at all 😉

## Why would I want to use this instead of _directly_ using USBIP/VirtualHere to forward controllers?

Diretly forwarding the Steam Decks (or similar devices) inputs via USBIP/VirtualHere comes with significant drawbacks:

- The forwarded device is entirely "removed" from the host machine  
    - You cannot use the device on the host machine at all while it's forwarded
    - There may be no way to "exit" the forwarding on the host machine without additional input devices or remote access,
    you have to disconnect the USBIP/VirtualHere session from the client side  
    This can be especially problematic if the host machine is a Steam Deck...
- USBIP on Windows specifically does not _currently_ work with the Steam Decks built-in controller
- VirtualHere is closed-source and requires a paid license for more than a single device
- I have personally experienced significant latency and input issues
  when using VirtualHere specifically on long gaming sessions
- On the Steam Deck (or similar devices), the Touchscreens inputs cannot be forwarded via USBIP/VirtualHere at all

SISR circumvents all of these issues by:

- Forwarding Steams Virtual Controllers instead of the physical device
- Forward additional Keyboard/Mouse devices alongside the controllers
- Providing "_an out_" using it's dedicated shortcut/controller chord (**`CTRL+SHIFT+ALT+S`**, **`LB+RB+BACK+A`**)
  to toggle the UI visibility and stop/start forwarding
- Being fully open-source and free to use  
   Even if a feature is not supported, everyone can grab the source-code
   of any part in the chain (except Steam itself) and implement it 😉

## What is USBIP?

**USBIP** is a protocol for tunneling USB devices over TCP/IP  
It allows a USB device on one machine to appear on another machine over the network (or localhost).

SISR uses USBIP (via [VIIPER](https://alia5.github.io/VIIPER/)) to create emulated controllers
that appear as real hardware at the system level

See [USBIP setup](../getting-started/usbip.md) for setup instructions

## What is VIIPER?

VIIPER (**V**irtual **I**nput over **IP** **E**mulato**R**) is the USBIP server that SISR uses to emulate controllers.

**VIIPER is bundled with SISR**  
you don't need to download/setup it separately  

VIIPER listens on:

- `:3241` for USBIP connections
- `:3242` for the control API

See the [VIIPER documentation](https://alia5.github.io/VIIPER/) for more details

## Common Issues

For common issues (doubled controllers, Steam CEF debugging, port conflicts, etc.), see: [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md)

## How do I uninstall this?

The installation scripts as well as the documentation tell you what is happening during install.  
To uninstall reverse those steps.  

=== "Windows"

    If you cant be bothered, run this in PowerShell

    ```powershell
    rm -rf "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\SISR"
    rm -rf "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\VIIPER"
    Remove-ItemProperty -Path "HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" -Name "VIIPER" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
    Remove-Item "$( [Environment]::GetFolderPath('Desktop') )\SISR.lnk" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
    Remove-Item "$env:APPDATA\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\SISR.lnk" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
    ```
    
    ??? info inline end "Driver Removal"
        ![Device Manager Driver Removal](../assets/usbip-uninstall.gif)

    The USBIP-Win2 driver can be removed via Device Manager

=== "Linux"

    If you cant be bothered, run this in a terminal

    ```bash
    rm -rf ~/.local/share/SISR
    rm -rf ~/.local/share/VIIPER
    sudo systemctl disable --now viiper.service
    sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/viiper.service
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo rm -rf /etc/modules-load.d/viiper.conf
    ```

    USBIP can be uninstalled via whatever package manager your distribution uses

## I want feature XYZ

Check [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Alia5/SISR/issues) to see if it's already requested  
If not, open a new issue  

No guarantees, though.  

Better yet, implement it yourself and open a pull request 😉  
Alternatively, you can hire me to implement it for you 😜
